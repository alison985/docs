# Datacoves Docs

## Welcome to the Datacoves Documentation

Our Mission is to be the _fast track to the Modern Data Stack_ so you can focus on **Delivering Results Quickly.**

## Contributing

We use [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) to generate our documentation.

It's simple, you just need to [learn Markdown](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/markdown).

### Install docsify

It is recommended to install docsify-cli globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```shell
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

### Preview it

```shell
docsify serve docs
```

### Add new links to the sidebar

Open [docs/\_sidebar.md](docs/_sidebar.md) and add the new links accordingly.
