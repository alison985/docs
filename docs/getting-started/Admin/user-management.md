1. To get new your users up and running, you need to invite them to the platform and grant them access to projects or specific environments. 

    [Invite Users](reference/admin-menu/invitations.md)

2. You can change the permissions for users via the Users admin screen.

    [User Management](reference/admin-menu/users.md)

3. When users no longer need access to Datacoves, you can delete their accounts.
