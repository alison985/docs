# Settings & Billing Menu

## Concept

From here you can adjust all your account-related settings: owner information, subscription actions, and even :warning: deleting your account

## Landing

This menu is divided into three main sections:

1. `Account Settings`, where you can change your account `name`

2. `Account Subscription`, where you can manage your subscription: changing your plan, billing periods, managing invoices and payments.
