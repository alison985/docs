# Users Menu

## Concept

<!-- TODO: Get a proper well-writen concept of what a Project in Datacoves is -->
From your Account Administration menu, you can manage the Users that belong to your account and grant them permissions over your different Environments. In Datacoves, there is no such thing as creating a user: you can modify, delete, or invite someone.

## Landing

Users landing page lists the Users that belong to your account, with their name, email, group(s) they belong to, and last login timestamp.

## Edit User

As stated in the beginning of this article, you can't create a User. What you can do is invite someone to join your Datacoves Account by clicking `Invite user` or using [Invitations menu](/reference/admin-menu/invitations.md)

However, what you can do is edit a User, in which case you can modify it's `Name`, `Email` and `Permission Groups` it belongs to.
